good for breakfast or tea!

At least two of the following:
One large sweet potato, chopped
One zucchini, cut into quarter-inch half-slices
One package of button mushrooms, sliced thin
Half a small cabbage, shredded
Two carrots, shredded or chopped fine
1/2 cup of chopped tomatoes
2" turkey keilbasa, chopped fine

Plus one of:
1/2 lb lean ground turkey
1/2 lb lean ground beef
1/2 lb lean ground anything animal you like to eat
1/2 package of extra-firm tofu, chopped fine,
1 pack of meatless ground
1 package soyrizo, chopped fine
1/2 cup tiny frozen shrimp
about 1 cup (more or less) chopped left over meat, any sort, though chicken is especially good.

And one of:
1 bottle hard apple cider
1 1/2 cup vegetable/chicken/beef broth, low salt low fat if available
1 little bottle v8 juice (not as good)
1/2 cup leftover white wine + 1 cup water or broth
1 1/2 cup water + a bullion cube
You get the idea, you need 1 1/2 cups of liquid, flavored is better.  (I have used cola.  Would not try again.)  ((leftover coffee wasn't bad.))

Plus: (you actually need this stuff.)
2 tsp. olive oil
1 smallish onion or equivalent, diced
Seasonings of your taste, depending on what you're putting in.  You always need salt, pepper is usually safe, and I add cayenne on autopilot.  Basil rarely goes amiss.  
REALLY GOOD NON STICK PAN.

Chop everything up and leave it in little piles all over your kitchen.  Heat your skillet, then add oil and onion.  Cook until the onion starts to soften, then add other vegetables + seasonings.   Saute a little bit until things start to brown, but they won't and shouldn't be cooked through yet. Turn down the heat a bit.  Add the liquid  and cook for about twenty minutes, covered, stirring every few minutes.   Veggies should be mostly cooked but not soft.  Continue cooking uncovered until liquid is gone.  Serve yourself a larger portion than you expect to eat and you'll almost always be right.
